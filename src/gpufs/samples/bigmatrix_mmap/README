This is a very basic matrix-vector multiply example where data is read/written from/to files

To compile: 
make fs

To generate  input matrices, use bigmatrix_cpu.
Note that the code assumes the input to perfectly match threadblock/grid dimensions.
For C2075 with 14 MPs I used grid sizes being multiple of 14, 256 threads. So the input matrices that were tested:
128K x 560, 128Kx1120,... etc.

For example, you can generate an input with:

> bigmatrix_cpu try 131072 560

and then run a GPUfs program with:

> ./fs 10 14 256 try_vector try_matrix out

This will run 10 trials with 14 threadblocks and 256 threads/block
