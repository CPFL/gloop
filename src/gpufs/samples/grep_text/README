This is a very basic multi-file string matching that works something like this:

for each word in dictionary
   for each file in the list
      grep -w word file  | wc >> out
  end
end

To compile: 
make fs


To simplify the GPU implementation the input dictionary is converted into a structured format with 32 symbols per word.

run_gpu.sh shows a sample run on a file with  complete works by Shakespere.

This is by far not a super efficient version, it just highlights the way GPUfs can be used
